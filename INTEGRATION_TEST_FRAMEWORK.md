# Integration Test Framework

## Overview

This document describes the integration test framework implemented for the location sharing application. The framework provides comprehensive testing infrastructure for both Android (Kotlin) and iOS (Swift) platforms, covering authentication, location services, friends management, and end-to-end user scenarios.

## Architecture

### Android Integration Testing

The Android integration test framework is built using:
- **Hilt** for dependency injection in tests
- **MockK** for mocking Firebase services and location providers
- **JUnit 4** for test execution
- **Espresso** for UI testing integration
- **Custom test doubles** for Firebase services

#### Key Components

1. **BaseIntegrationTest**: Base class providing common setup and utilities
2. **IntegrationTestRunner**: Custom test runner using HiltTestApplication
3. **Mock Services**: Test doubles for Firebase Auth, Firestore, Realtime Database, and Location Services
4. **Test Modules**: Hilt modules providing mock implementations

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Setup
- Each test class sets up its own test data in `setUp()` methods
- Mock services provide controlled test data
- Test data is isolated between test runs
- Cleanup is performed in `tearDown()` methods

### Test Data Patterns
- Use consistent test user IDs and emails
- Provide realistic location coordinates
- Use timestamp-based data for uniqueness
- Clear test data between test runs

## Best Practices

### Test Organization
- Group related tests in the same test class
- Use descriptive test method names
- Follow Given-When-Then structure
- Include both positive and negative test cases

### Async Testing
- Use proper async/await patterns
- Set appropriate timeouts for operations
- Handle async operation failures gracefully
- Use expectations for complex async scenarios

### Mock Configuration
- Reset mock state before each test
- Configure mocks for specific test scenarios
- Verify mock interactions when necessary
- Use realistic mock data and responses

### Error Testing
- Test error scenarios alongside success cases
- Verify error handling and recovery
- Test network failure scenarios
- Validate user-facing error messages

## Continuous Integration

### CI Pipeline Integration
The integration tests are designed to run in CI environments:
- Tests use mock services (no external dependencies)
- Deterministic test data and timing
- Proper cleanup and isolation
- Comprehensive error reporting

### Test Reporting
- JUnit XML reports for Android
- XCTest reports for iOS
- Code coverage reports
- Test execution timing metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Android
- **Hilt injection failures**: Ensure `@HiltAndroidTest` annotation is present
- **Mock service not working**: Verify `TestInstallIn` configuration
- **Test timeouts**: Increase timeout values for slow operations
- **Permission issues**: Configure mock permissions properly

#### iOS
- **Async test failures**: Use proper expectation handling
- **Mock delegate issues**: Ensure delegate is set correctly
- **Memory leaks**: Use weak references in test doubles
- **Simulator issues**: Reset simulator state between runs

### Debugging Tips
- Use logging in mock services to trace execution
- Add breakpoints in test setup methods
- Verify mock configuration before test execution
- Check test isolation by running tests individually
