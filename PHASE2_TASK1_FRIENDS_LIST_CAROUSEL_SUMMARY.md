## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced Animation System

```kotlin
// Staggered entrance with 150ms delay per item
LaunchedEffect(hasAppeared) {
    if (hasAppeared) {
        delay(index * 150L) // Phase 2 requirement: 150ms delay per item
        shouldAnimate = true
    }
}

// Multi-state scale animations
val itemScale by animateFloatAsState(
    targetValue = when {
        isSelected -> 1.15f    // Selected state
        isFocused -> 1.1f      // Focused state
        else -> 1.0f           // Normal state
    },
    animationSpec = FFinderAnimations.Springs.Bouncy
)
```

### Micro-Interaction Enhancements

1. **Online Indicator Pulse**:
   - Continuous pulsing animation for online friends
   - Radial gradient glow effect
   - Scale animation from 1.0f to 1.2f

2. **Selection Feedback**:
   - Immediate scale response (1.0f â†’ 1.15f)
   - Dynamic shadow elevation changes
   - Color transitions for text and indicators
   - Haptic feedback on selection

3. **Focus States**:
   - Visible focus rings for keyboard navigation
   - Color-coded focus indicators
   - Smooth transition animations

### Synchronization Architecture

```kotlin
// Bidirectional selection synchronization
onFriendClick = { friendId ->
    friendsViewModel.selectFriend(friendId)
    // Auto-scroll and highlight map marker
    scope.launch {
        mapTransitionController.focusOnFriend(
            friend = friend,
            cameraPositionState = cameraPositionState,
            zoomLevel = 16f,
            duration = 1200
        )
    }
}
```
