- Proper cleanup of map resources before navigation
- Context-aware navigation preparation

### 2. Authentication and User Management Integration

**Authentication Validation:**
- Implemented validateAuthenticationIntegration method
- Proper handling of authenticated vs unauthenticated states
- Anonymous user detection and rejection
- User profile access validation

**User Management Integration:**
- Added testUserManagementIntegration method
- User ID and profile validation
- Anonymous user handling
- Proper error handling for authentication failures

### 3. Friend Data Integration with Backend Services

**Real-time Friend Data:**
- Integration with FriendsRepository for real-time friend updates
- Friend count tracking and display
- Friend request handling integration
- Proper error handling for friend data failures

**Backend Service Integration:**
- Friend visibility control integration
- Location sharing permissions with friends
- Friend interaction methods (ping, stop receiving location)
- Real-time friend status updates

### 4. Location Sharing Integration with Privacy Controls

**Privacy Control Management:**
- Enhanced handlePrivacyControlChange method
- Backend privacy settings integration
- Authentication requirement for privacy changes
- Friend visibility control implementation

**Location Sharing Service Integration:**
- Integration with LocationSharingService
- Privacy-aware location sharing controls
- Proper error handling for sharing failures
- Status synchronization with backend

## Key Components Implemented

### MapScreenIntegrationManager
```kotlin
@HiltViewModel
class MapScreenIntegrationManager @Inject constructor(
    private val auth: FirebaseAuth,
    private val friendsRepository: FriendsRepository,
    private val locationSharingService: LocationSharingService
) : ViewModel()
```

**Key Methods:**
- `validateAuthenticationIntegration()`: Validates user authentication
- `testFriendDataIntegration()`: Tests friend data backend integration
- `testLocationSharingIntegration()`: Tests location sharing integration
- `testUserManagementIntegration()`: Tests user management integration
- `testAppFlowIntegration()`: Tests complete app flow integration
- `handleNavigationEvent()`: Handles navigation with proper cleanup
- `handlePrivacyControlChange()`: Manages privacy controls with backend sync

### IntegratedMapScreen Component
```kotlin
@Composable
fun IntegratedMapScreen(
    onBack: () -> Unit,
    onNearbyFriends: () -> Unit,
    integrationManager: MapScreenIntegrationManager = hiltViewModel()
)
```

**Integration Features:**
- Comprehensive integration validation on composition
- Authentication state validation
- Friend data integration testing
- Location sharing integration testing
- Complete app flow integration testing
- Error handling and logging

### Integration State Management
```kotlin
data class IntegrationState(
    val isAuthenticated: Boolean = false,
    val userId: String? = null,
    val friendsData: List<Friend> = emptyList(),
    val friendsCount: Int = 0,
    val isLocationSharingActive: Boolean? = null,
    val locationSharingStatus: String? = null,
    val error: String? = null
)
```
