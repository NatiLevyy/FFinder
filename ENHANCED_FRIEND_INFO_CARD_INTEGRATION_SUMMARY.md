val selectedEnhancedFriend: StateFlow<EnhancedFriend?>
val actionStates: StateFlow<Map<ActionType, ActionState>>

// Automatic conversion and state synchronization
fun selectFriend(friendId: String) {
    val friend = _uiState.value.friends.find { it.id == friendId }
    val enhancedFriend = friend?.let { EnhancedFriend.fromFriend(it) }
    _selectedEnhancedFriend.value = enhancedFriend
    // Initialize action states and track analytics
}
```

## Error Handling and Retry Logic
